# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Introduction
This repository showcases our solution for the Recommendation System Kaggle competition üèÜ, where we achieved fourth place. 
This competition aims to predict user movie ratings using a modified version of the MovieLens 32M dataset üé¨.

## Problem Statement:
In today's digital age, recommendation systems have emerged as the backbone of popular platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon, changing how we discover content! 
These advanced systems utilize the power of data like analyzing user behavior & item interactions in order to forecast which items users will be drawn to next. 

## Approach Summary:
For this project, we focused on building a recommendation system using the NeuMF (Neural Matrix Factorization) model. This powerful hybrid model for collaborative filtering combines the strengths of matrix factorization and deep learning.

We customized and improved the NeuMF architecture by incorporating additional metadata such as genres, years, and statistics of the movies. This enhancement helped improve the contextual understanding of each movie's characteristics, adding a layer of interpretability to our recommendations.
